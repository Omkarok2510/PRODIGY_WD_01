		<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I'm OMKAR ASHOK KARALE, an intrepid explorer fueled by wanderlust and curiosity. 
			From remote corners of the globe to bustling city streets, I thrive on discovering the extraordinary in the ordinary. 
			Let's embark on adventures and unravel the mysteries of our world, one journey at a time.
			I have lived in both Chicago and the District of Columbia.
			Some of my favorite things to do are read, 
			listen to music, and ride public transportation (buses and trains).
			These are activities that I enjoy immensely and indulge in daily.
			My career aspirations are to become DATA SCIENTIST.
			I have been told that I am a charming, kind, attitude-prone 
			person with "oddities". I look up mostly to my family members, especially
			my mom, as a guiding figure in life. Favorite shows of mine include 
			Doctor Who, Sherlock, Triple D (Diners, Drive-Ins' and Dives), Hustle,
			and Chopped (yes, the majority of those are British TV shows, problem, mate?).
			Just a few things about yours truly</p>
